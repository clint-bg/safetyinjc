To compile run:
jupyter book build 

If you need to rebuild the workflow file deploy.yml then type:
jupyter book init --gh-pages
This only needs to happen once I think.

Also push the update to the repository at github
git add ./*
git commit -m "commit"
git push

I couldn't figure out how to update the picture in the primary sidebar but
 I did get google analytics integrated
