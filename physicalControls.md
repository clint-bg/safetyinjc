# Physical Safety (Controls)
After identifying the hazards in a hazards analysis and understanding the behavior of chemicals and associated processes, implementing controls to minimize hazards can be done in a number of ways. The most effective way is to reduce the quantity, reactivity, amount, and the number of people exposed and time that people are exposed with inherent safety practices. Also completing hazards analysis in the design phases is much more effective at reducing hazards than after the fact. This section discusses the importance of pressure reliefs to control exposures of hazards.
