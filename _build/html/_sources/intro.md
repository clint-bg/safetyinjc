# Stewardship and Safety in Jesus Christ
God our Heavenly Father's work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39). That immortality is having and maintaining a living body of flesh and bone forever. It is also being able to live with God our Heavenly Father forever through the infinite and eternal atonement of Jesus Christ. We will live there according to the laws and ordinances that define the environment where God our Heavenly Father lives. 

## Safety in Jesus Christ
Safety in Jesus Christ is applying systematic methods to ensure the physical and spiritual health of ourselves and those around us such that we can have immortality and eternal life. There is safe practices for our physical bodies and for the chemical systems for with which we will work. There is also, perhaps more importantly, safety for our souls and the spiritual souls that surround us.

## God-Given Stewardship
We have been given stewardship for our lives, our bodies, and the land that we have been given to live on together with all the other children of God on all continents of Earth. Our actions as chemical engineers can be magnified for the benefit of man (Haber-Bosch process for example) or to the detriment of man (derivatives of the Haber-Bosch process to wage war for example).

## Course Outline
This class treats those two broad topics (safety and stewardship) in addressing the following subtopics:

### Spiritual Safety in Jesus Christ (Section 1)
- Ethics
- AIChE Code of Ethics

### Physical Safety (Section 2)
- Process Safety Management (PSM)
- Hazards Analysis

### Process Safety Information
- Toxicology
- ESD
- Fires and Explosions
- Dispersion, etc.
- Other PSM Sub Programs
- Management of Change, etc.

### God-Given Stewardship (Section 3)
- Environment (Local vs Global, Acute vs Chronic)
    - Land
    - Water
    - Air
    - Regulations

## Learning Outcomes
### ABET
- Students will be able to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
- Students will function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
- Students will be able to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.

### BYU
- Students will exhibit critical and creative thinking skills for analysis and evaluation of problems and cause-effect relationships.
- Students will be able to make order of magnitude estimates, assess reasonableness of solutions, and select appropriate levels of solution sophistication.
- Students will be able to to pass the HAZCOM test.
- Students will be able to describe a procedure for making and implementing ethical decisions and effectively apply the procedure to ethical problems of practical interest.
- Students will be able to define integrity, and demonstrate understanding of how it applies to their lives and how to develop it through practice.
- Students will understand teamwork principles including: recognition of team members' strengths and weaknesses; importance of effective communication skills; recognition of unique contributions of team members; and the need to facilitate team members' development.
- Students will understand what it means to be a leader and the importance of self-awareness in leadership, and how to develop a vision, establish goals, formulate a strategy, and develop a plan consistent with that strategy.
- Students will understand and commit to practice the AIChE code of ethics.
- Students will understand the need for safe engineering practices; demonstrate knowledge of pertinent safety laws and regulations (including RAGAGEPs); understand and have a basic knowledge of how safety considerations are incorporated into engineering design.
- Students will be able to apply principles of risk management, Hazards and Operability Studies (HAZOPS), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and fault-tree analyses in process design.
