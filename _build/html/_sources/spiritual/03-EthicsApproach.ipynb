It is common for ethical dilemmas to be convoluted combinations of many issues and it is tempting to hastily jump in and try to solve the problem. When we do, we often focus on the wrong problem and end up exacerbating the entire situation. Often dilemmas are nothing more than a lack of communication. \n",

Patience is also required. It is easy to jump to conclusions based on one person's opinion or on less than all the data. Contractual, legal, and ethical obligations and commitments must be included as part of the definition.\n",
