The process of transferring these materials from one location to another during processing occurs regularly. One such scenario is the transfer of a small quantity of Compound B from a pass-thru box to a hopper that feeds a press. An operator carries the Compound B in a small jar from the pass-thru box to the hopper. The scope of the analysis is from the time the operator picks up the jar of Compound B to the time the jar is emptied into the hopper."

The operator picked up the jar of Compound B from the pass-thru box and was walking towards the hopper when the operator fell. The jar flew towards the hopper and upon impact exploded and caused a fire. The operator was injured and the fire was extinguished by the fire suppression system. The operator was taken to the hospital and treated for burns and lacerations. The operator was released from the hospital the next day."
