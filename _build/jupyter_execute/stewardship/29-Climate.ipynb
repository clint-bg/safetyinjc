    "The Earth gets energy from the sun and core of the earth is still quite hot. The energy from the sun is the main driver of the climate on Earth. The energy from the sun is not evenly distributed over the Earth's surface. The equator gets more energy than the poles. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth and then re-emitted as infrared radiation. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of this infrared radiation and re-emits it back to the Earth's surface. This is the greenhouse effect. Without this greenhouse effect, we would be living in a much colder world."
