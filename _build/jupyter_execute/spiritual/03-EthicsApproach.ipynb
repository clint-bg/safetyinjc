    "Carefully determine the root dilemma to be resolved. What is the real problem? It is common for ethical dilemmas to be convoluted combinations of many issues and it is tempting to hastily jump in and try to solve the problem. When we do, we often focus on the wrong problem and end up exacerbating the entire situation. Often dilemmas are nothing more than a lack of communication. \n",

    "Proper definition requires some sleuth work as the relevant data are gathered, the history of the situation is traced, the layers of \"who said what and when\" are peeled away, and the real dilemma is brought to light. Patience is also required. It is easy to jump to conclusions based on one person's opinion or on less than all the data. Contractual, legal, and ethical obligations and commitments must be included as part of the definition.\n",

    "Consider possible actions and then forecast the outcome. This is something like a chess game since there are multiple possible outcomes for a given action depending upon the reactions of others. A good chess player looks multiple moves ahead to anticipate outcomes, and this same mentality is valuable in considering actions to resolve an ethical dilemma. Use the clear principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and consider the possible courses of action from each possible course of action. The above ethics principles can be helpful. What actions would be suggested by each ethics theory? The outcomes that need to be considered include the impact on others including the public, co-workers, and family. It is helpful to organize your analysis in a flowsheet that traces actions and outcomes.\n",
