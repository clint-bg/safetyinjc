TNT detonation blast pressures (both side-on and reflective), impulse (integral of the blast pressure with respect to time), and arrival times have been experimentally measured for spherical and hemispherical (ground level) blasts of TNT at various distances and various TNT masses. The data for those tests are given in the TM5-1300 document or in other references like UFC 3-340-02. These data have been fit to a model that is used to assess the hazards from explosions (of TNT or otherwise). If the explosive is not TNT, testing or modeling is done to determine the equivalent TNT mass. The TNT model (with the scaled TNT mass) is then used to assess the hazards.\n\nOne very large hazard from TNT blasts is the shock wave (and blast wind) referred to as over-pressure. Typically, over-pressure is measured in psi (pounds per square inch) or kPa (kiloPascals). The over-pressure is the pressure above the ambient pressure. The over-pressure is a function of the distance from the explosion and the TNT mass.\n\nOverpressure blast effects are typically categorized as follows:\n\n>0.4 psig: limited minor structural damage\n\n0.4-1.0 psig: window breakage to partial demolition of houses\n\n1-5 psig: significant damage to buildings to nearly complete destruction of houses\n\n>5 psig: severe damage\n\nThere is approximately 4184 J of energy per gram of TNT.

If someone is not committed to a specific principle set, it is easier to make unethical decisions with one or more justifications or rationalizations.\n\nIt is best to commit to a set of principles prior to the time when you are faced with an ethical decision.\n\nEthics Approach Step 1\n\nDefine\n\nNote\n\nCarefully determine the root dilemma to be resolved. What is the real problem? It is common for ethical dilemmas to be convoluted combinations of many issues and it is tempting to hastily jump in and try to solve the problem. When we do, we often focus on the wrong problem and end up exacerbating the entire situation. Often dilemmas are nothing more than a lack of communication.\n\nProper definition requires some sleuth work as the relevant data are gathered, the history of the situation is traced, the layers of “who said what and when” are peeled away, and the real dilemma is brought to light. Patience is also required. It is easy to jump to conclusions based on one person’s opinion or on less than all the data. Contractual, legal, and ethical obligations and commitments must be included as part of the definition.\n\nEthics Approach Step 2\n\nConsider and Analyze\n\nNote\n\nConsider possible actions and then forecast the outcome. This is something like a chess game since there are multiple possible outcomes for a given action depending upon the reactions of others. A good chess player looks multiple moves ahead to anticipate outcomes, and this same mentality is valuable in considering actions to resolve an ethical dilemma. Use the clear principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and consider the possible courses of action from each possible course of action. The above ethics principles can be helpful. What actions would be suggested by each ethics theory? The outcomes that need to be considered include the impact on others including the public, co-workers, and family. It is helpful to organize your analysis in a flowsheet that traces actions and outcomes.\n\nEthics Approach Step 3\n\nPlan\n\nNote\n\nWith the results of your analysis, it is time to select and plan your strategy. As you plan and prepare to put your plan into action, seek the guidance of the Spirit. Your plan will usually be a process involving several or many steps rather than a one-step action. Some steps may involve data gathering, and some will be dependent upon the intermediate responses and reactions of others. A good plan will produce inner peace—it will let you sleep at night.\n\nEthics Approach Step 4\n\nSeek Confirmation\n\nNote\n\nAfter you have done your homework and decided on a plan, you should seek divine approbation. (See D&C Section 9.) If this does not come, then more homework is most likely needed (Items 1, 2, and 3 above.) When you have this approval, then it is time to put the plan into action.\n\nEthics Approach Step 5\n\nAct\n\nNote\n\nDo it. Carry out your plan, being cautious and flexible as events unfold. Stick to your principles, but be humble and willing to admit your own failings and culpability\n\nEthics Approach Step 6\n\nReflect\n\nNote\n\nEach time we go through the process of dilemma resolution, we should learn about ourselves and others. Take the time to digest the lessons learned so that your wisdom can increase in preparation for the next time. It helps to take some notes or make entries in a journal\n\n","type":"content","url":"/spiritual/ethicsapproach#additional-ethics-resources-and-activities","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"03-Ethics Approach","lvl2":"Some Ethics Case Examples"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/spiritual/ethicsapproach#some-ethics-case-examples","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"03-Ethics Approach","lvl2":"Some Ethics Case Examples"},"content":"\n\nChernobyl Firefighters\n\nMilitary Agreement of (Mission, Reactor, Ship, then Crew)\n\nLimited Information results in Bad Decision\n\nThe Challenger Disaster\n\nPersonal Story: Home Purchase\n\nSulfanilamide Delayed Release\n\nThe 1971 Ford Pinto\n\nCensorship","type":"content","url":"/spiritual/ethicsapproach#some-ethics-case-examples","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"God-Given Stewardship"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/stewardship","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"God-Given Stewardship"},"content":"We have been given stewardship for our lives, our bodies, and the land that we have been given to live on together with all the other children of God on all continents of Earth.

That jar is then transferred to a hopper that also is shielded. The hopper feeds a press that forms the material into a shape that is used in the production of ammunition.\n\nSDS (Example information for illustrative purposes only)\n\nThe SDS for Compound B has the following applicable items:\n\nPhysical and Chemical Properties - Compound B is a white powder that is odorless. It is a complex of a reactive salt and heavy metals. It is toxic to living organisms and is unstable. It is sensitive to heat, shock, ESD, impact, and friction.\n\nStability and Reactivity - Compound B is unstable and is sensitive to heat, shock, ESD, impact, and friction.\n\nToxicological Information - Compound B is toxic to living organisms.\n\nHandling and Storage - Compound B should be stored in a magazine. During processing, a portion of the storage amount is separated inside a shielded enclosure into a small jar. That jar is then transferred to a hopper that also is shielded.\n\nExposure Controls and Personal Protection - Operators should wear lab coats and gloves when handling Compound B. Operations should control ESD and avoid impact and friction scenarios.\n\nSmall-scale Safety Testing\n\nSafety testing with friction, impact, and ESD devices have shown that the threshold initiation level (a 3.4% chance of ignition) is 30 lbf at 8 feet per second, 10 cm, and 150 mJ, respectively.\n\nEquipment Details\n\nThe pass-thru box is a shielded enclosure that has a door on each side. The operator opens the door on one side and places the jar of Compound B inside. The operator then closes the door and opens the door on the other side. The operator then removes the jar of Compound B from the pass-thru box. The hopper is a shielded enclosure that has a door on the top. The operator opens the door and empties the jar of Compound B into the hopper. The operator then closes the door.\n\nPrevious Incidents\n\nThere have been no previous incidents involving the transfer of Compound B from the pass-thru box to the hopper.

The solubility of a gaseous species is dependent on the temperature and pressure of the system. Henry’s Law can be used to predict the concentration of a species in a liquid:\n\ny_iP = H_ix_i\n\nwhere: y_i is the mole fraction of species i in the gas phase, P is the pressure of the gas above the liquid, H_i is the Henry’s Law constant for the species i, and x_i is the mole fraction of the species in the liquid.\n\nHenry’s law is very similar to Raoult’s Law, which states that the partial pressure of a species in the vapor phase  is directly proportional to the product of the mole fraction of the species in the solution and the pure component saturated vapor pressure of that species. Both ‘laws’ are limit cases where Henry’s Law is for dilute solutions and Raoult’s Law is for ideal solutions.","type":"content","url":"/stewardship/summary#henrys-law","position":9}]}
