# Acknowledgement
I acknowledge the use of large language models (ChatGPT, Bard, Github Copilot) and Wikipedia in the development of the content of this course. Additionally, content from other instructors at Brigham Young University has been incorporated. I also acknowledge the use of the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) project to develop this book. Other sources used referenced within the text. Chemical Process Safety by Daniel A. Crowl and Joseph F. Louvar (Fourth Edition) was especially useful. The majority of the content comes from my 15 years of experience in the defense industry as a safety consultant.
