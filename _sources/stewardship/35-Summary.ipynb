    "Bioaccumulation is the accumulation of substances, such as pesticides, or other chemicals in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost. This can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact. The substance can accumulate in the organism's tissues, and can be passed on to the next trophic level in a food chain. Bioaccumulation can have harmful effects on organisms, and can lead to biomagnification, which is the increase in concentration of a substance as it moves up the food chain."

    "Solubility is the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent. The solubility of a substance is dependent on the temperature and pressure of the solvent. The solubility of a substance can be expressed as the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent. The solubility of a substance can be determined experimentally, and can be used to predict the behavior of the substance in a given solvent."

Both 'laws' are limit cases where Henry's Law is for dilute solutions and Raoult's Law is for ideal solutions."
