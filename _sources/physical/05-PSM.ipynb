We need tools to estimate risks for specific scenarios or actions, and we need tools to reduce those risks."

Spiritual injury is not as straight forward and it's difficult to recognize sometimes. For that reason, we'll primarily focus on physical risks. However, we can define spiritual harm as being separated from God if we fail to keep His commandments. Some activities are not edifying and participating in those may not immediately lead to committing a mistake or sin. However, small acts of setting aside God can result in spiritual or emotional trauma. In that light, could you ranking the following events?\n",
