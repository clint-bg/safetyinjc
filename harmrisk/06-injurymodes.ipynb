    "1. Estimate the heat flux from a burning burst natural gas pipeline (shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EverTT2D0NM). Estimate the heat flux at a distance of 50 feet from such a scenario. Assume a flow of natural gas of 0.25 kg per second.\n",
    "2. Pick a needed chemical that is used in the plastics or rubber industry. Find and read a toxicology report on its effects on the body and summarized what you learned.\n",
    "3. Pick a chemical that is a toxin and review the literature to determine teh pathway or process by which the body removes that specific chemical.\n",
    "4. Review the \"Green Beans Canning Procedure\"[](#greenbeans) and detail three specific potential physical injury modes (e.g., thermal, overpressure, or blunt force) that could occur during this home process.\n",
    "5. Read, watch a video, or otherwise learn about an incident as described by the US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) as detailed at csb.gov. Document some of the details of the event and what should happen in the future to prevent a similar accident.\n",
