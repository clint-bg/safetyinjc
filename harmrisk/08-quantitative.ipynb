    "There are many statistical distributions including the normal distribution, chi squared, exponential, etc. that can be used to model event probabilities.  One of the most common distributions used in reliability engineering is the Poisson distribution.  The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.  The probability of observing $k$ events in a given time period is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the treatment here, we will create a $\\lambda'$ prime that is the rate per unit time and we will also only care that k or the number of events is greater than or equal to 1.  This is because we are interested in the probability of at least one event occurring in a given time period. As such, the following is true of the probability estimate:\n",
