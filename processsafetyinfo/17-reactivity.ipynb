    "```{warning} Action Items\n",
    "1. Calculate the heat of reaction at standard conditions for the production of formaldehyde from methane and oxygen (CH$_4$+O$_2$→HCHO+H$_2$O). Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction? Why?\n",
    "2. Download the appropriate portion of the Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards{cite:p}`Breth` and outline the hazards stated on using butanol with aluminum. Also list what happened to the aluminum distillation column with a reason why.\n",
    "3. What are estimates of enthalpy and Gibbs energy of reaction for methane pyrolysis at 1000 C? The text{cite:p}`FSPSwCP` on Page 116 can help you make an estimate.\n",
    "4. Reproduce the plot in Figure VI.1{cite:p}`FSPSwCP`. Also plot the enthalpy of reaction for the same temperature and pressures. Describe differences in the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy at a pressure of 200 atm and temperatures of 450 C and 600 C and what those values mean.\n",
    "5. What percentage increase to the reaction rate in Eq. VI.3{cite:p}`FSPSwCP` occurs with a 90% temperature increase from 175 to 333C (given a typical activation energy of 50kJ/mol)?\n",
    "6. Generate a compatibility matrix for the chemicals in your house. Include at least four (4) chemicals. "
