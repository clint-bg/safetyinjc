    "Inerting is the process of replacing the atmosphere in a vessel with an inert gas (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc). This is done to prevent the formation of flammable/explosive mixtures. There are multiple approaches to purging and inerting:\n",
    "- vacuum purge (removing the atmosphere from the vessel and replacing it with an inert gas in stages; stages used to prevent the container from collapsing)\n",
    "- pressure purge (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with an inert gas by pressurizing the vessel, also completed in stages)\n",
    "- sweep purging (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with an inert gas by flowing the inert gas through the vessel)\n",
    "- siphon purging (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with a liquid then filling with an inert gas)\n",
    "- combination of the above"
