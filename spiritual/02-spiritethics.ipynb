    "Tad Callister spoke on the importance of integrity on \"Becoming Men and Women of Integrity.\" Elder Tad Callister defines integrity as **a state of purity in mind and heart, devoid of deceit, excuses, rationalizations, or any misrepresentation of facts**.  It entails absolute honesty with oneself, God, and fellow human beings. It involves making **decisions based on eternal implications** and necessitates disclosing the complete truth without any alibis or excuses.  Furthermore, integrity demands **keeping covenants and commitments**, even in inconvenient times, and being internally driven, not governed by the presence of others. He urges listeners to embrace integrity not out of obligation but out of genuine desire, highlighting the Lord's acceptance of those who strive to live with integrity."
