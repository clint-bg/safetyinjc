    "\n",
    "Jesus Christ taught us to love one another (John 13:34-35) and to care for our bodies as they are temples (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). As stewards of our physical and spiritual well-being, we have a responsibility to ensure safety in all aspects of our lives. This course explores the principles of safety from both spiritual and physical perspectives, emphasizing the importance of ethical decision-making and risk management.\n",
