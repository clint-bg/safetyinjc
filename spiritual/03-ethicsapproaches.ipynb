    "Carefully determine the root dilemma to be resolved. What is the real problem? It is common for ethical dilemmas to be convoluted combinations of many issues and it is tempting to hastily jump in and try to solve the problem. When we do, we often focus on the wrong problem and end up exacerbating the entire situation. Often dilemmas are nothing more than a lack of communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proper definition requires some sleuth work as the relevant data are gathered, the history of the situation is traced, the layers of \"who said what and when\" are peeled away, and the real dilemma is brought to light. Patience is also required. It is easy to jump to conclusions based on one person's opinion or on less than all the data. Contractual, legal, and ethical obligations and commitments must be included as part of the definition.\n",

    "Consider possible actions and then forecast the outcome. This is something like a chess game since there are multiple possible outcomes for a given action depending upon the reactions of others. A good chess player looks multiple moves ahead to anticipate outcomes, and this same mentality is valuable in considering actions to resolve an ethical dilemma. Use the clear principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and consider the possible courses of action from each possible course of action. The above ethics principles can be helpful. What actions would be suggested by each ethics theory? The outcomes that need to be considered include the impact on others including the public, co-workers, and family. It is helpful to organize your analysis in a flowsheet that traces actions and outcomes.\n",

Some steps may involve data gathering, and some will be dependent upon the intermediate responses and reactions of others. A good plan will produce inner peace—it will let you sleep at night.\n",

    "Technician A is a field technician employed by a consulting environmental engineering firm. At the direction of his supervisor (Engineer B), Technician A samples the contents of drums located on the property of a client. Based on Technician A's past experience, in his opinion the analysis of the sample would most likely determine that the drum contents would be classified as hazardous waste. If the material is hazardous waste, Technician A knows that certain steps would legally have to be taken to transport and properly dispose of the drum, including notifying the proper federal and state authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technician A asks his supervisor, Engineer B, what to do with the samples. Engineer B tells Technician A only to document the existence of the samples. Technician A is then told by Engineer B that since the client does other business with the firm, Engineer B will tell the client where the drums are located, but do nothing else. Thereafter, Engineer B informs the client of the presence of drums containing \"questionable material\" and suggests that they be removed. The client contacts another firm and has the material removed."
