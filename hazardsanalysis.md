# Hazards Analysis
God our Heavenly Father's work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39). Immortality is having and maintaining a living body of flesh and bone forever. Protection of people and resources from harm is a part of immortality. In this module we highlight that process with Process Safety Management (PSM); specifically process hazards analysis (PHA) tools and techniques.
