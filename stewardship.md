# God-Given Stewardship
We have been given stewardship for our lives, our bodies, and the land that we have been given to live on together with all the other children of God on all continents of Earth. Our actions as chemical engineers can be magnified for the benefit of man (Haber-Bosch process for example) or to the detriment of man (derivatives of the Haber-Bosch process to wage warÂ for example).
