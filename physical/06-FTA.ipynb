    "Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, deductive failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events. This analysis method is used to understand how systems can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce risk, and to estimate event rates of a safety accident or a particular system level (functional) failure."

    "A batch reactor is used to complete a reaction needed for the benefit of others. The reactor process has the following processing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reactor is filled with the raw material, a somewhat toxic material.\n",
    "2. The reactor is heated  to the desired temperature (100 F).\n",
    "3. The reactor is pressurized to the desired pressure (20 psig).\n",
    "4. Reactant B is slowly added to the reactor. An exothermic reaction occurs and the jacket must begin to cool the reactor to maintain the desired temperature.\n",
    "5. The reaction proceeds at a given reaction rate at that temperature and pressure until all of the reactant B has been added.\n",
    "6. The reactor is cooled to room temperature and the product is removed."
