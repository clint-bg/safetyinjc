# Process Safety Information
God our Heavenly Father's work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39). Immortality is having and maintaining a living body of flesh and bone forever. Protection of people and resources from harm is a part of immortality. In this section we highlight that process with Process Safety Management (PSM); specifically process safety information (PSI) tools and techniques. 

There are twenty elements part of the process safety management (PSM) required by OSHA for organizations working or storing chemicals above a certain threshold. The threshold for explosives is 0, meaning any amount of explosives qualifies the company to comply with PSM. The regulation is part of the code of federal regulations (CFR) as outlined here: [29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA PSM)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-XVII/part-1910/subpart-H/section-1910.119). The primary element is Hazards Analysis and secondarily Process Safety Information.
