    "A piping and instrumentation diagram can be very detailed or it can simply denote key process components. Build drawings are for the construction of the plant and can be very detailed. Those diagrams are usually proprietary and so dificult to get an example to show. However, there are public domain examples of P&IDs. The P&ID published here is  from a somewhat complex Aspen Plus flowsheet of the Haber-Bosch process.  It was published [here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cherd.2023.06.031](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cherd.2023.06.031). The drawing lacks details on instrumentation."

PID symbols are not standardized, so you may see different symbols used in different diagrams. PID's are very helpful, invaluable, in designing a process plant (Smokeless powder manufacturing in Mulwala, NSW, Australia). The P&ID is a more detailed diagram than the PFD.  It shows the process flow, but also shows the instrumentation and control devices.  \n",
