    "- Ad hominem: attacking the person instead of the argument.\n",
    "- Appeal to authority: using the opinion or position of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument.\n",
    "- Appeal to emotion: manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.\n",
    "- Appeal to fear: using fear to influence the conclusion.\n",
    "- Appeal to flattery: using flattery to influence the conclusion.\n",
    "- Circular reasoning: supporting a statement by repeating it in different words. Similar to affirming the consequent: if A, then B. B, therefore A. Also similar to begging the question: assuming the conclusion in the premise.\n",
    "- False dilemma: giving two choices when in fact there are three or more.\n",
    "- Cause and effect: assuming that the effect is related to a cause because the events occur together. Implying causation from correlation.\n",
    "- Sunk cost: assuming that future events will be affected by past events, which have no bearing on future outcomes.\n",
    "- Strawman: creating a false or made up scenario and then attacking it. Similar to a red herring: diverting attention from the real issue by focusing instead on an issue having only a surface relevance to the first.\n",
    "- Tu quoque: avoiding having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser - answering criticism with criticism.\n",
    "- Wishful thinking: making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason.\n",
    "- Slippery slope: asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact.\n",
    "- Herd mentality: doing or thinking things because many other people do or think the same. Similar to bandwagon: doing or thinking things because many other people do or think the same."
