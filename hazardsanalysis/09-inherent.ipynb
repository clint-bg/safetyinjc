For example, a few days ago, the Los Angeles Times reported about Zuko Carrasco, who was paralyzed while leading people on a trust fall. He blames himself as he was the last to descend when what he thought he heard was \"on belay\" but his belayer was not yet ready. He jumped and fell 40 feet and was paralyzed from the waist down. He had safely completed that activity many times before."
