This analysis method is used to understand how systems can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce risk, and to estimate event rates of a safety accident or a particular system level (functional) failure."

    "1. The reactor is filled with the raw material, a somewhat toxic material.\n",

    "3. The reactor is pressurized to the desired pressure (20 psig).\n",

    "5. The reaction proceeds at a given reaction rate at that temperature and pressure until all of the reactant B has been added.\n",

    "```{warning} Action Items\n",
    "1. Draw a Fault Tree Diagram for the production of polyethylene. Most safety concerns are around the plug flow reactor with a highly exothermic reaction occurring. A compressor is used to pressurize the ethylene feed to near 1500 bar. A cooling jacket surrounds the plug flow reactor where the temperature is controlled to near 70C. A separator is then used to collect the polyehtylene solids and the unreacted ethylene is recycled.\n",
    "2. Identify a \"Top Level Event\" for a commute to school and deduce at least three sub-events that could lead to that outcome.\n",
    "3. Comment on the both the success and failure portions of the Fault tree for spiritual scenarios FIgure V.10{cite:p}`FSPSwCP` page (95). What covenants have you made or could you make with God to help you succeed and draw closer to God?\n",
