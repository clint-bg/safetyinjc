    "Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, deductive failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events. This analysis method is used to understand how systems can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce risk, and to estimate event rates of a safety accident or a particular system level (functional) failure."
