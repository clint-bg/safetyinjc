    "1. Use the pytorch to fit the relationship for the drag coefficient of a sphere as a function of Reynolds number. See the class lecture notes, code at https://github.com/clint-bg/safetybook, AI, and or Note 1 for Chapter 11{cite:p}`FSPSwCP` for tips. The data to fit can be found here: https://github.com/clint-bg/safetybook/blob/main/spheredragcoeffdat.csv. Use a Neural Net with an architecture of 1x15 and then 15x1 for the hidden or output layer. Report your weights that you optimized and the drag coefficient value your model gives for a Reynold number of 3e5. Also include a plot of your model (as a line) and the data (as points).\n",
    "2. Take a picture of Figure XI.2 and submit the image to an AI chatbot with a prompt about identifying possible failure modes for personal injury when working with a reactive chemical subject to friction, impact, ESD, and thermal initiation scenarios. Compare the list of failure modes to that given in the text (page 290-292). Summarize your findings and thoughts.\n",
