    "1. Define the process\n",
    "\n",
    "This step can involve collecting documentation such as a process flow diagram (PFD), piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID), operating procedure and other relevant information. It is also important to gather information about the process, such as the materials used, and the operating conditions among other things.\n",

    "2. Identify the hazards analysis method to use\n",
