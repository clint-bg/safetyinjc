# Case Study Documentation
You'll be required to write a document of each case study you complete as a three-person team. The document should be a minimum of 400 words. The summary should include the following:   
- An executive summary.
- A description of the scenario.
- A description of the experimental setup with a photo or diagram.
- A description of the modeling/theoretical approach.
- A description of the results you obtained (experimental and theoretical).
- Figures detailing those results.
- Conclusions you drew from the modeling and experimental results.
- Contribution statement for each team member and an estimate of the total time that the group spent on the study.

You can use generative AI such as ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc. to help you draft and write, and rewrite your document.
