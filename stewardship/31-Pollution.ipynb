The canal was abandoned and used as a chemical waste dump in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1970s, residents of the Love Canal neighborhood began to report health problems, including birth defects, miscarriages, and cancer. Investigations revealed that the site was contaminated with over 20,000 tons of hazardous waste, including dioxin, benzene, and other chemicals. The Love Canal site was declared a federal emergency in 1978, and the residents were evacuated. The site was later cleaned up and capped, and is now a public park."
