    "The above equations can be rearranged to solve for the area of the orifice, $A$, for a given flow rate and other conditions. Note that the discharge coefficient, $C_d$, is a function of the geometry of the orifice and the flow conditions. The discharge coefficient is typically determined experimentally with viscosity, downstream piping, backpressure, and other factors influencing the value. Estimates for some of those parameters can be found in Chapter 10 of Crowl and Louvar. For a preliminary estimate, a value of 0.65 is often used for liquid flow and 0.9 for gas flow."
