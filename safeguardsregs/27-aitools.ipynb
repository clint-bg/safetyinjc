    "2. Take a picture of Figure XI.2 and submit the image to an AI chatbot with a prompt about identifying possible failure modes for personal injury when working with a reactive chemical subject to friction, impact, ESD, and thermal initiation scenarios. Compare the list of failure modes to that given in the text (page 290-292). Summarize your findings and thoughts.\n",
