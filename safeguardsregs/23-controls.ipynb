    "Inerting is the process of replacing the atmosphere in a vessel with an inert gas (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc). This is done to prevent the formation of flammable/explosive mixtures. There are multiple approaches to purging and inerting:\n",
    "- vacuum purge (removing the atmosphere from the vessel and replacing it with an inert gas in stages; stages used to prevent the container from collapsing)\n",
    "- pressure purge (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with an inert gas by pressurizing the vessel, also completed in stages)\n",
    "- sweep purging (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with an inert gas by flowing the inert gas through the vessel)\n",
    "- siphon purging (replacing the atmosphere in the vessel with a liquid then filling with an inert gas)\n",

    "**Inherent Safety**: Designing the process to eliminate or reduce the use of toxic gases or vapors.\n",
    "- **Substitution**: Replace the toxic gas or vapor with a less toxic or non-toxic alternative.\n",

    "- **Isolation**: Use of barriers or other methods to separate the toxic gas or vapor from workers.\n",

    "Ventilation occurs with HVAC systems where air is circulated and filtered. However, most of the air is recirculated and only a small fraction is replaced with fresh air. The recirculation of air can lead to a build up of toxic gases and or distribute them to other areas of the workplace.\n",

    "Ventilation where outside air is brought in can help reduce the concentration of toxic gases or vapors but it has significant energy costs.\n",
