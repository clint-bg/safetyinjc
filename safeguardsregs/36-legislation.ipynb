However, some government policies on either a local or national level can have unintended consequences. For example, recently some cities or states have banned single-use plastic bags. Instead, constomers were given the option to reuse or purchase larger more massive plastic bags. This has led to an increase in the amount of plastic waste and some health risks with reusing bags."
